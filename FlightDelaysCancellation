•	Design

1st visualization is 3 plots of bar charts show 

The Airline vs Total Delay: it shows that Southwest Airlines co has the highest delay.
The Airport vs Total Delay: Chicago Midway Internation Airport has the heights delay.
The Most Delay Reasons: it shows that Departure delay is the most reason for delay 

The bar here is simple and clear.


2nd visualization is a multiple visualization of Line charts show
 
The Total delay vs Month and weekdays in one chart: found that July has the highest delay among all months. Middle of week (day 3, 4, 5) are the most frequent of high delay in week days.

Line chart is the best choice to see the variation with time.


3rd visualization is a map show 
The states vs cancellation with different reason of cancellation via the filter
Found that MA State has the most cancellation. Most cancellation are due to weather Conditions.

Map chart is an easy way to show variations over different locations

•	Feedback: I received a feedback to :
•	Remove null values from the filter, so a new set is created to exclude the null values.
•	The Axis of week day should exclude values of 0 and 8 , so the axis is  edit to start with 1 to 7 .
